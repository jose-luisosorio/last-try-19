            <p>Our team set out to provide a service that allows users to find a song based solely on their personal recollection, while using their own natural voice to search. Thus, eliminating the need to rush to ones phone, struggling to open an app in enough time, in hopes to perform a successful song search and match. Our team hopes to break new ground in the music discovery space that our predecessors have been unable to materialize thus far. As we undergo further research, we can become one of the most valuable tools in this next generation of AI-Assisted Music Exploration.</p>

            <h4>ASPCA Website Redesign</h4>
            <p>We are challenged with evaluating and improving the UI of a nonprofit. From initial brainstorming, we decided to explore improving the UI of the adoption process of the ASPCA website.  We want to find out what pain points users might have during the process, and how we can push the UI design to help make adopting through the ASPCA website more efficient, effective, and enjoyable.</p>

            <p>To this day, COVID-19 has undoubtedly changed the way travel and tourism operate. What was once a relatively easy process, has now become riddled with horror stories of non-refunded tickets, unexpected quarantines, and online ambiguity to international travel operations. My organization TrafalGar  is developing a post-COVID flight planning app to help travelers find a way to navigate through the muddy waters of international travel in and out of post pandemic America.</p>
